# Emissions-MIP

This repository holds scripts and files used for contributions to the Eissions-MIP Sensitivity Evaluation project

## Brief Overview
The Emissions-MIP (EMIP) Emissions Sensitivity Evaluation project aims to determine what uncertain aspects of emissions data have the greatest impact on climate & aerosol model ouptut. One motiviation for the project is that some groups have reported substantially different simulation results when using the new [CEDS](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/ceds/) CMIP6 datasets (as compared to the inventories used for CMIP5), while other groups have not encountered this sensitivity. While the exact reasons for this descrepency aren't clear, several possible explainations exist. For example, new emissions datasets may contain seasonality for all emissions species where the older ones did not; the time series total and spatial distribution of shipping emissions is also different from previous versions, which might impact models with strong aerosol indirect effects over ocean regions. 

Multi-model sensitivity tests will be conducted to determine which aspects of aerosol-related emissions impact model results. The project will be anchored by two leading model groups, [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov/) and [NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS)](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/), with GISS, HadGEM-UKCA, NCAR, OsloCTM3, and GEOS modeling groups participating.

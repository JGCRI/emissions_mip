This directory holds scripts that turn CAM5 time-slice output files to timeseries files using NCAR's [PyReshape](https://github.com/NCAR/PyReshaper) package. 

The shell scripts are used to submit the Python scripts to the job scheduler on the pic HPC cluster. The Python scripts themselves do the actual work.
